# Hiring Process - Organic growth through contributors and traditional Job Postings :sun_with_face: :seedling: :tulip: :sunflower:

At **Nautilus** we do many things differently. One of them is how we grow our team and how we define our team.

## Our concept of Team :raising_hand: :ok_woman: :woman:

Our team is made up of people who share two common interest:

- They love to learn and explore and become better developers.
- They choose to work on our projects to add value to the community because they believe in them and love to contribute to them.

Given this, we consider part of our team:

- Our companies’ employees.
- Our external paid contributors.
- Our voluntary unpaid contributors.

## Hiring through Organic Growth

The organic growth of our team is our preferred method.
To date, our companies’ employees usually are contributors whom we have invited to receive a salary to exclusively work on our projects. 
They are the team members who have proven themselves to be consistent value creators and reside in a country where we operate and therefore have been asked to join as employees.

## Hiring through Traditional Job Postings

In rare occasions we also make public job postings via Linkedin, through our local network and or other online platforms.

Such occasions are for example when:

- We open operations in a new location.
- We need to incorporate specific skills.
- We wamt to speed up growth.

In these cases we take the following steps:

- Post a job.
- Review all the applications.
- Discuss them internally.
- Make a selection of ten.
- Invite the selected candidates to a first online interview with two people from our team.
- There maybe additional interviews depending on our founders' availability so that the candidates can also meet them.

## Employees and Paid Contributors

### Becoming an Employee or Paid Contributor :sunglasses: :raising_hand: :clap:

For us at Nautilus a passionate and interested contributor is someone who enjoys working on any of our repositories and shares our projects’ vision.

What we look for is **proactive contributors**. Someone who speaks up and suggests changes, makes improvements, etc. frequently and consistently.  Also, it does not matter if you are new to development or an experienced veteran if you are interested and involved in our projects we will notice you.

For us you will prove yourself by the amount of interaction with our projects. Contributions to discussions, completed issues, code reviews, documentation creation and improvements, etc these are just a few of the ways we will notice you. Your work will be proof of your commitment, interest and professionalism, as well as for your willingness to share and learn.

In Open-Source it is easy to see anyone’s involvement, so **you just have to contribute to get noticed**.

### Paid Contributors

Now, paid contributors can be anyone whose contributions add value who are not joining Nautilus for personal reasons. Such contributors, we believe, add value and we choose to reward them monetarily for this. Such rewards can take different forms:

- Donations (patreon, etc.)
- Invoice for freelancers

### Unpaid Contributors

Unpaid contributors are also key to our project community’s progress. They actively add to our projects but do so in their spare time, for the sheer pleasure, and therefore not being able to spend more time on our projects.
